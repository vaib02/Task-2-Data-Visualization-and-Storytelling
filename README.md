# Task-2-Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling

Objective: Create visualizations that convey a compelling story.
Tools used: Tableau

- Generated a random dataset file with the name "Superstore_Sample_15_Rows.csv"
- Imported the .csv file to Tableau.
- Tableau loaded the data — clicked “Sheet 1” at the bottom.
- Dragged "Category" to Columns and "Sales" to Rows. For a region-based visualisation, I added "Regions" to the Columns too.
- Selected Bar chart for the data visualisation.
- Used a maximum of 3 key colors, one for each category.
- Marked Label for the highest sales in each category.
- Added Average Lines to the Bars.
- Created a New Dashboard for Summary and Highlights.
- Created "Sheet 2" for a visualisation of sales by each product ID.
- Dragged "Category" and "Product ID" to Columns and "Sales" to Rows.
- Selected Bar Chart for visualisation.
- Reduced the thickness of bars and changed color.
- Enabled "Mark Label" for each bar.
